# dbus-vestel-evc04-charger

Integrate Vestel EVC04 into Victron Energies Venus OS as an evc

## Purpose

With the scripts in this repo it should be easy possible to install, uninstall, restart a service that connects to an Veste EVC04 to the VenusOS and GX devices from Victron.

## Inspiration

This project is my first on GitHub and with the Victron Venus OS, so I took some ideas and approaches from the following projects - many thanks for sharing the knowledge:

- https://github.com/vikt0rm/dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter
- https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/dbus#evcharger

## How it works

### Details / Process

As mentioned above the script is inspired by @vikt0rm dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter implementation.
So what is the script doing:

- Running as a service
- connecting to DBus of the Venus OS `com.victronenergy.evcharger.evc04_{DeviceInstanceID_from_config}`
- After successful DBus connection the values of the Vestel EVC04 system information are read via modbus
- Paths are added to the DBus with default value 0 - including some settings like name, etc
- After that a "loop" is started which consumpton and status date vom evc and updates the values in the DBus

Thats it üòÑ

## Install & Configuration

### Get the code

Just grap a copy of the main branche and copy them to a folder under `/data/` e.g. `/data/dbus-vestel-evc04-charger`.
After that call the install.sh script.

The following script should do everything for you:

```
wget https://github.com/lrep/dbus-vestel-evc04-charger/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip "dbus-vestel-evc04-charger-main/*" -d /data
mv /data/dbus-vestel-evc04-charger-main /data/dbus-vestel-evc04-charger
chmod a+x /data/dbus-vestel-evc04-charger/install.sh
/data/dbus-vestel-evc04-charger/install.sh
rm main.zip
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Check configuration after that - because service is already installed an running and with wrong connection data (host, username, pwd) you will spam the log-file

### Change config.ini

Within the project there is a file `/data/dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter/config.ini` - just change the values - most important is the deviceinstance, custom name and phase under "DEFAULT" and host, username and password in section "ONPREMISE". More details below:

| Section   | Config vlaue   | Explanation                                                                                                  |

| DEFAULT   | SignOfLifeLog  | Time in minutes how often a status is added to the log-file `current.log` with log-level INFO                |
| DEFAULT   | Deviceinstance | Unique ID identifying the shelly 1pm in Venus OS                                                             |
| DEFAULT   | CustomName     | Name shown in Remote Console (e.g. name of pv inverter)                                                      |
| DEFAULT   | Phase          | Valid values L1, L2 or L3: represents the phase where pv inverter is feeding in                              |
| DEFAULT   | Position       | Valid values 0, 1 or 2: represents where the inverter is connected (0=AC input 1; 1=AC output; 2=AC input 2) |
| ONPREMISE | Host           | IP or hostname of on-premise Shelly 3EM web-interface                                                        |
| ONPREMISE | Username       | Username for htaccess login - leave blank if no username/password required                                   |
| ONPREMISE | Password       | Password for htaccess login - leave blank if no username/password required                                   |
